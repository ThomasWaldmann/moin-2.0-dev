Python requirements
===================

MoinMoin requires Python >= 2.6, we recommend using 2.6.x.

Python 3.x won't work for MoinMoin for now.

Python build options:
 * zlib support (required)
 * ucs4 (32bit unicode, recommended)
 * ucs2 also works for most users (not recommended)


Servers
=======
You can use anything that speaks WSGI to moin:
 * the builtin "moin" server (recommended for desktop wikis, testing,
   debugging, development, adhoc-wikis)
 * apache with mod_wsgi (recommended for bigger/busier wikis)
 * other WSGI-compatible servers
 * For cgi, fastcgi, scgi, ajp, ... you can use the "flup" middleware:
   http://trac.saddi.com/flup
 * For IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003, you can use a ISAPI-WSGI gateway:
   http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/ v0.4.1 has been used successfully.


Requirements needed for some moin features
==========================================

For dependency information of python libs, please see setup.py.
If you use easy_install or pip, this is usually automatically dealt with.


Bundled 3rd party code
======================

Below are some notes about the software we bundle and ship with MoinMoin.
If you are a Linux distributor and you want to rip out this stuff and
replace it with packages, this is for you!

We list the shipped version and also the minimum required version.
The shipped version will work best with moin as usually has some more bug
fixes than the minimum required version.
We do not test with the minimum required version, but we try to keep this
file updated and correct to our best knowledge.

In case you find bugs in this requirements specification, please let us know!

Thanks to all 3rd party software authors!
