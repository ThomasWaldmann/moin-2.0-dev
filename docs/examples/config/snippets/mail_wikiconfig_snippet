    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows how to configure email support.
    # See HelpOnConfiguration/EmailSupport and HelpOnConfiguration for more infos.

    # SENDING MAIL - e.g. for page subscribtions or sending of forgotten passwords.

    # the "from:" address [Unicode]
    mail_from = u"wiki <wiki@example.org>"

    # a) using a SMTP server, e.g. "mail.provider.com" (None to disable mail)
    mail_smarthost = "smtp.example.org"

    # if you need to use SMTP AUTH at your mail_smarthost:
    #mail_login = "smtp_username smtp_password"

    # b) alternatively to using SMTP, you can use the sendmail commandline tool:
    #mail_sendmail = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"
