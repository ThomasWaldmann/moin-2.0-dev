    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows moin's auth configuration.
    # See HelpOnAuthentication and HelpOnConfiguration for more infos.

    # authentication methods used (default shown, see also other snippets):
    # if autocreate is True user profiles are created automatically

    # With HTTPAuthMoin moin does http basic auth all by itself:
    #from MoinMoin.auth.http import HTTPAuthMoin
    #auth = [HTTPAuthMoin(autocreate=True)]

    # With GivenAuth moin relies on the webserver doing the authentication:
    #from MoinMoin.auth import GivenAuth
    #auth = [GivenAuth(autocreate=True)]

    # auth methods that get a user into "Trusted" group:
    #auth_methods_trusted = ['http', ]

    # The default (ENABLED) password_checker will keep users from choosing too
    # short or too easy passwords. If you don't like this and your site has
    # rather low security requirements, feel free to DISABLE the checker by:
    #password_checker = None # None means "don't do any password strength checks"

    # To add the OpenId authentication one must add it to the auth list.
    #from MoinMoin.auth.openidrp import OpenIDAuth
    #auth = [OpenIDAuth()]

    # By default OpenID authentication accepts all openid providers. If you
    # like you can set what openid services to allow by adding their urls to the
    # trusted_providers keyword of OpenID auth.
    # If left empty moin will allow all providers.
    # eg. To allow only google profile openids:
    #auth = [OpenIDAuth(trusted_providers=['https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud?source=profiles'])]
