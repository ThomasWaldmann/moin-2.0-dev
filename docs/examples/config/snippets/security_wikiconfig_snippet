    # This is a sample configuration snippet that shows how to configure security
    # features of moin, like superuser, ACLs and anti-spam / anti-abuse measures.

    # This is checked by some rather critical and potentially harmful actions,
    # like PackageInstaller action:
    #superuser = [u"YourName", ]

    # IMPORTANT: grant yourself admin rights! replace YourName with
    # your user name. You need to apply the ACL specified below to the
    # backends you would like to use them for! See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more help.
    # content_acls = dict(hierarchic=False,  # True to use hierarchical ACLs
    #                     before=u"YourName:read,write,delete,revert,admin",
    #                     default=u"Trusted:read,write,delete,revert Known:read,write,delete,revert All:read,write",
    #                     after=u"", # most users don't need this
    # )

    #actions_excluded = ['xmlrpc'] # change this if you need xmlrpc or to forbid other actions

    # Avoid users filling your hard disk with attachments:
    #unzip_single_file_size = 2.0 * 1000 ** 2
    #unzip_attachments_space = 200.0 * 1000 ** 2
    #unzip_attachments_count = 101 # 1 zip file + 100 files contained in it
