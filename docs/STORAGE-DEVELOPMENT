Notes for Developers (storage)
==============================

 This document contains information about things that are broken and must be
 fixed. Additionally, it also contains information on things that need to be
 done before the storage code can be used productively.
    
    - In some scenarios, the FSBackend keeps too many files open, which causes
      an exception to be shown. See http://tinyurl.com/5paw95 for a traceback.


    - In order to allow future versions of the storage API to act in a
      "delete" friendly way (i.e., not disallowing deletion of items / revisions
      by design), changes must be made to the create_revision and list_revision
      methods.
      Status quo:   Revisions must be created with subsequent revision numbers.
                    This, however, is a limitation of the Backends as they are
                    implemented right now. This will be changed. The API already
                    mentions that this will be changed at the appropriate spots.
      What we want: Allow revisions to be created with monotonic, but not
                    necessarily subsequent revision numbers.

      The idea is to use some "purge" script. The script in fact is a clone
      script, but while cloning, it leaves out revisions and items flagged as
      "purged" or "truly deleted". (This differs from normal wiki page deletion
      in that not only a new, empty revision with a DELETED metadata key is
      created.)
      One could assume that, while cloning, the current semantics of
      list_revisions and create_revision with respect to revision numbers is
      preserved and all revisions in the new backend (target of clone) are
      simply renumbered. That, however, is a bad idea, since you already exposed
      your wiki to the internet and some people may already be using specific
      revision numbers to refer to specific versions of a page. In those cases,
      the information provided by the page behind the url may be unexpected.
      Thus, "skipping" some revision numbers is necessary.
