    # This sample configuration snippet shows using fs for storage.
    # Note: the "fs" filesystem backend is not compatible to moin 1.x.

    # Import mapping creator - it helps you to create a simple mapping for the
    # 'content', 'trash' and 'userprofiles' backends.
    # The "fs:" prefix is needed to tell "I want to use fs backend" and is
    # stripped internally.
    # The path following the "fs:" prefix gives a directory that will contain
    # all data for all backends.
    # E.g.:
    # given:    "fs:/home/myuser/mywiki"
    # sets up:  /              -> "/home/myuser/mywiki/content/"
    #           /Trash/        -> "/home/myuser/mywiki/trash/"
    #           /UserProfiles/ -> "/home/myuser/mywiki/userprofiles/"
