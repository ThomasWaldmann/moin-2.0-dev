    # This is a sample configuration snippet for a wiki which uses a Mercurial
    # based storage backend.
    # Note that you have to install Mercurial first, if you don't have it already.


    # Basic configuration.
 
    # Import enduser backend.
    from MoinMoin.storage.backends import create_simple_mapping
   
    # Provide a string which consists of backend prefix (hg) and destination 
    # directory where data will be placed (instance), separated by a colon.
    namespace_mapping = create_simple_mapping('hg:/home/myuser/mywiki/%(nsname)s')

    # If you want to use a more advanced config, please refer to HelpOnStorageConfiguration.
