    # This is a sample configuration snippet for a wiki which uses a Mercurial
    # based storage backend.
    # Note that you have to install Mercurial first, if you don't have it already.


    # Basic configuration.
 
    # Import enduser backend.
    from MoinMoin.storage.backends.enduser import get_enduser_backend
   
    # Provide `backend_uri` which consists of backend prefix (hg) and destination 
    # directory where data will be placed (instance), separated by a colon.
    storage = get_enduser_backend('hg:instance')


    # Advanced configuration. Use this as a reference.

    # Import backends.
    from MoinMoin.storage.backends import enduser, hg

    # Data backend, this is where wiki items are stored.
    # If the directory you provide doesn't exist, it will be created at runtime.
    data = hg.MercurialBackend('instance/data')
    
    # User backend, which stores only non-versioned items metadata.
    # If the directory you provide doesn't exist, it will be created at runtime.
    user = hg.MercurialBackend('instance/user')

    # Create RouterBackend instance and pass MercurialBackend endpoints.
    storage = enduser.get_enduser_backend(mapping=[('/', data), ], user=user)
