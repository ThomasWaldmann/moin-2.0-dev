    # MoinMoin uses (shared) secrets in some subsystems. These secrets are NOT passwords, you
    # will never have to enter them as a moin wiki user. Don't re-use some of your passwords
    # as a secret, just use some long random string.
    # For example, the 'action/cache' secret is used to calculate unpredictable cache access keys.
    # The 'mailimport' secret is a shared secret for importing e-mail via xmlrpc (you will have
    # to copy it to the mailimporter script).
    #
    # IMPORTANT: Don't use the strings below, they are NOT secret as they are part of the moin
    #            distribution archive's config samples.

    # For low security requirements (all subsystems will use this same secret then):
    secrets = 'I&TNny^UVBUasdK^NN&T^^RyyujB^UN^B^UNBasrgrttdNFU^BFNasad'

    # For higher security requirements, you can use different secrets for different subsystems:
    secrets = {
            'action/cache':'35gnb35h8g0835hgnbe035g85b8',
            'wikiutil/tickets': 'asdasdvarebtbertbaetbtrbetgrergfqe3r',
    }
