What makes MoinMoin special?
----------------------------
Moin tries to be a **great wiki engine** (good, powerful, extendable and still
easy-to-use). We don't try to be everything else also, we don't try to be
minimalistic either.

There are lots of wiki engines out there and it is hard to choose.
But choosing wisely is a good idea, because you'll have to live with your
choice for a longer time (switching wiki engines is not easy).

We won't list all moin features right here, because comparing feature lists
is just not enough. For some "features" it is even better if one does *not*
implement them, even if they sound great at first. Also, you will find most
important features in most major wiki engines - but still, you and your wiki
users might feel quite a different overall experience just because of a bunch
of tiny unsuspiciously looking differences. Also, of course the quality of
implementation of some feature can vary in a wide range. Thus, you have to
try it, play with it, not just look at feature comparisons.

MoinMoin has **been there since about year 2000**.
Until moin 1.9.x it has quite rapidly grown and evolved, its developers have
also grown their experience with Python and wiki technology over the years.
With **moin 2.0**, based on that experience, there has been a rather
**revolutionary cleanup / rewrite** of how moin works - to make it easier,
cleaner, better, more consistent, more powerful, more flexible and more
modular.

Moin is **written in Python** (an easy to read, high-level, object-oriented,
dynamic, well-designed and platform-independent programming language) - it
is fun to write clean code with Python.

Even if you are not a developer, but just a wiki admin or user, you indirectly
take advantage of this (believe it or not, software developers are humans,
too - if they use a crap programming language that is hard to read, badly
designed and requiring them to write big amounts of code even for trivial
things, it is hard for them to create and maintain a great software based on
that).

And you even could learn a bit of Python and extend moin as you like!

Moin is **Free Software** (that implies that it is **Open Source**) and,
because we use Python, you may even *like* to read and modify moin's code.
