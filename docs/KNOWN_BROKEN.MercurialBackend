Broken stuff:
- GraphInfo sometimes draws inconsistent revision graph

- RecentChanges may produces tracebacks when reading concurrently from
	repository changelog and getting all revisions, 
	this vanished after adding some boosters but is likely to reappear on heavier
	load

- after backend backup (hg backup/ hg clone --pull), cloned backend is not
	willing to serve requested revision data and crashes

- data synchronisation (hg pull/push) is NOT working :(
