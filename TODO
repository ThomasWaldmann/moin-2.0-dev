AttachFile is dead
------------------

action=get is the new way for downloading or raw viewing of an item

remove AttachFile usage from packages / PackagePages refactor

replace AttachList(pagename=None, mime_type='*') macro (removed) by SubItems macro (todo)
mig script?

same for AttachInfo(pagename=None) ?

moin maint reducewiki / mkpagepacks / cleanpage
moin export dump

consequences on migration scripts ?

ATT* in edit-log?

Removed wiki xmlrpc attachment related parts. Check wikisync & co whether it
works for any item type / fix xmlrpc accordingly.


Page / Page*Editor is almost dead, stuff moving to new MoinMoin.items package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

send_page is not used any more - see MoinMoin.action.show.
sendEditor is not used any more / action "edit" is "modify" now - see MoinMoin.action.modify.
Both miss lots of functionality.

Some actions like content/print/format were removed (all called do_show /
send_page internally).

Page / Page*Editor is deprecated, move functionality from there to MoinMoin.items.

PageGraphicalEditor was removed, it contained only sending of FCKeditor and
this currently is not used anyway. See 1.9 repo for latest code.

MoinMoin.items has a Item hierarchy for highlevel items (!= storage items), like:
Item, NonExistent, Binary, Image, Text, ...
Currently it is all in one file, can be split later.

Everything we want to be able to do with items should be implemented there.
Stuff shall be implemented at the MOST GENERAL LEVEL of the hierarchy.


templating engine jinja used now
---------------------------------

See MoinMoin.support.jinja.

Used by new modify and show action.

Only used for content div right now, the theme is still rendered by "old"
MoinMoin.theme code.

Don't work right now, please help debugging / fixing.
