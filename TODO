AttachFile is dead
------------------

do=get is the new way for downloading or raw viewing of an item

TODO: replace AttachList(pagename=None, mime_type='*') macro (removed) by SubItems macro (todo)
mig script?

TODO: same for AttachInfo(pagename=None) ?

TODO: moin maint reducewiki / mkpagepacks / cleanpage
TODO: moin export dump

consequences on migration scripts ?

ATT* in edit-log?

Removed wiki xmlrpc attachment related parts.
TODO: Check wikisync & co whether it works for any item type / fix xmlrpc accordingly.


Page / Page*Editor is almost dead, stuff moving to new MoinMoin.items package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

send_page is not used any more - see MoinMoin.action.show.
sendEditor is not used any more / action "edit" is "modify" now - see MoinMoin.action.modify.
TODO: Both miss lots of functionality.

Some actions like content/print/format were removed (all called do_show /
send_page internally).

Page / Page*Editor is deprecated.
TODO: move functionality from there to MoinMoin.items.

PageGraphicalEditor was removed, it contained only sending of FCKeditor and
this currently is not used anyway. See 1.9 repo for latest code.

MoinMoin.items has a Item hierarchy for highlevel items (!= storage items), like:
Item, NonExistent, Binary, Image, Text, ...
Currently it is all in one file, can be split later.

Everything we want to be able to do with items should be implemented there.
Stuff shall be implemented at the MOST GENERAL LEVEL of the hierarchy.

ACL TODO:
"delete" ACL right: kill it, makes no sense.
"revert" ACL right: same?
"create" ACL right: add this?
"move" ACL right: add this? note: includes deletion if implemented by Trash/*

DELETE TODO:
implement deletion as mv X Trash/X - do we still need meta[DELETED] then?
index pages: could filter by name (thus not displaying Trash/*, except if wanted)


templating engine jinja used now
---------------------------------

See MoinMoin.support.jinja.

Used by some new actions, like modify, show, diff, ...

Only used for content div right now, the theme is still rendered by "old"
MoinMoin.theme code.

Removed all theme code except "modernized" theme.
TODO: create a jinja2 based theme.

tests

Don't work right now, please help debugging / fixing.
