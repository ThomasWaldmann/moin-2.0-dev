Documentation and Support
=========================

Online:

Project homepage is at http://moinmo.in/ - there are also links to support
resources and informations about MoinMoin development status and plans.

In general, please make sure that documentation you read on the wiki or
somewhere else on the web is written for the moin version you are using.

For support, please try the documentation, the homepage, the irc channel
and the mailing list before contacting the MoinMoin authors directly.

If you have trouble with apache (or other webserver) configuration, please
try reading the web server's documentation. Same thing applies for any other
3rd party software usually used with moin, but not written by the MoinMoin
developers.

Local:

See docs/CHANGES                 for a version history. READ THIS!
See docs/REQUIREMENTS            for a list of requirements.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

We have to thank a lots of people for their valuable ideas, time and
contributions - please see the MoinMoinAcknowledgements page there:
