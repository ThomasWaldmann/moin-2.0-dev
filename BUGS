This file documents further bugs in the storage code and design.
I've gotten tired of fixing them, it seems that way I just get
blamed for everything instead of the original coder/designer of
the problems...

 BUG 1: error handling is totally bogus
========================================

Error handling is wrong by design: backends are currently not required
to raise proper errors but they simply give an error whenever something
fails and the common code tries to fix this up. This is _obviously_
racy, consider an example:

thread 1			thread 2
 - create_item(n) fails
				 - rename_item(n, x)
 - _handle_error
 - has_item returns False
 - original OSError is raised,
   upper layers completely
   fuck up, OSError shown to
   user

SOLUTION: require that backends atomically check whether an
          operation is possible and raise an *appropriate*
          error code, rather than trying to "fix up" the
          error code later.

SIDE EFFECT: actual backend bugs can be found rather than
             leading to, for example, "item exists" errors
             when the item doesn't actually exist.


 BUG 2: create_item is racy
=============================================

Due to the way create_item works, it is not possible to implement
a higher-level atomic 'create page with this contents' operation,
no matter how it is done another thread could reference that item
before it is completely created. [Before flaming me about how wrong
I am, please read the solution and realise that it is already half-
implemented but neither properly documented nor actually properly
implemented.]

SOLUTION: Abstract locking in from the backend and clearly document
          that although locks are always named by the items they are
          supposed to lock this is not a hard requirement and it must,
          for example, be possible to lock an item that doesn't exist
          yet.

          To clarify that point, remove locking methods from backends
          and create a new lock-manager class that is also configured
          in the wiki configuration but is completely orthogonal to
          the backend.

          With the newly gained flexibility, add locking around all
          code using create_item/save/..., this might require Page/
          PageEditor code refactoring.

SIDE EFFECT: will clarify that all locks live within a shared namespace
             as it is currently the case with the filesystem backends
             (cfg.tmp_dir) and thus help improve code quality since it
             will be apparent to lock users.

[NB: Due to filename quoting and a . being present in the user IDs
it is currently not actually possible for locking namespaces to
collide but we'd rather not rely on that for all future, would we?]


 BUG 3: storage code assumes it is perfect
===========================================

In many places, operations look like this:

  item.lock = True
  [...]
  item.lock = False

While that should of course be called 'locked' and not 'lock', the
code sequence itself is rather worrying because any bugs within the
"[...]" part will lead to locks that are not released. This is in
particular visible with the test suite where a small problem in one
test case will cause a lot of follow-up test cases to fail due to
the unreleased lock, but I'm sure cases can be constructed where
the current code will fail within such a block.

QUICK-HACK SOLUTION: add try/finally to all the code and try to
                     enforce that in the future (yeah right)

SOLUTION: Instead of doing lock/unlock like this, require a method
          call that is done to operate on the locked item, like this:

          item.locked(m)

          which would be implemented like this (using the old, then
          no longer existing, lock property):

          self.lock = True
          try:
            m()
          finally:
            self.lock = False

          Note that my example doesn't allow passing any parameters
          to the function, that can be alleviated by using *args and
          **kwargs or simply requiring that the function takes no
          arguments in which case a lambda would be used to pass any
          (which would even be py3k compatible in that case because
          IIRC *args/**kwargs can no longer be used then)

SIDE EFFECT: It will no longer be possible to hold locks for a longer
             period of time, nor to forget unlocking. Also, doing
             things this way clearly documents which methods are done
             locked and leads to an overall improvement in code quality.


 BUG 4: Despite claims otherwise, remove_item is used
======================================================

When a user edits a page that doesn't exist, this page is created via
create_item() as soon as the user invokes the edit action, at which
point the item starts to exist. Because it has no revisions, the upper
level code will still assume that it doesn't exist, but this is unclean
at best.

Also, it has interesting side effects, like this race that is trivial
to trigger:

User 1					User 2
 - edit non-existing item 'asdf'
					 - do same
 - hit cancel
 - see that item doesn't exist
					 - do same

At this point, user 2 gets a big fat ugly exception message from the
backend that the item he tried to delete doesn't exist. WTF?

Also, when trying to edit the item 'asdf' again some other bug happens
which in turn invalidates the 'code is perfect' assumption above and
triggers the missing unlock bug.

Another race that isn't quite as easy to trigger is this:

User 1/Thread 1				User 2/Thread 2
 - edit non-existing item 'asdf'
 					 - do same
 - invoke save with actual text
					 - cancel edit
					 - page editor's cancel function
					   is invoked, calls
					    - get_revisions, which returns
					      an empty list
**** alternative 1
 - save code creates revision,
   saves data, metadata
					 - because of empty list,
					   remove_item is invoked
--> COMPLETE DATA LOSS

**** alternative 2
 - save code creates revision
					 - beause of empty list,
					   remove_item is invoked,
					   newly created revision is
					   removed
 - save code saves data, metadata
   and FAILS!
--> User 1 is gets a moin bug in form of an ugly backtrace

SOLUTION: See above, locking on items that do not exist is necessary.

SOLUTION: Alternatively, the whole create_item/remove_item business could
          be completely reworked so that the item/revision is only created
          when it is saved. Locking is still required, of course, but can be
          pushed to a place where it can be implemented more intelligently,
          namely the backend.


 BUG 5: ItemCollection is instantiated too often
=================================================

ItemCollection attempts to implement caching but all the code it has
for that purpose (which has quite some overhead due to the way the
cache is refreshed!) is completely useless since it is instantiated
every time a page object is instantiated. Then on each access it will
read the global edit log to make sure the cache is fresh, when in fact
the cache cannot really ever not be fresh.

SOLUTION: Make ItemCollection a singleton, preferably by making all item
          accesses in all code go through request.cfg.pages_collection
          and request.cfg.user_collection.

SIDE EFFECT: The ItemCollection no longer has access to the request
             object. This is good because it forces removing the
             request edit-lock  handling from the storage layer where
             it most definitely does not belong.

NOTE: See bug 6.


 BUG 6: rename_item can pull an item underneath another thread
===============================================================

When an item is renamed, the following race can occur:

Thread 1				Thread 2
 - item = collection['asdf']
 - rev = item[0]
					 - rename_item('asdf', 'zzz')
 - rev.get_data()

--> Thread 1 crashes because item has been renamed away from it
    although it had a valid reference.

Yes, this race can happen in Moin 1.6/1.7, but the storage code is
about improving it, and with a proper design and better backends it
is trivial to avoid such races.

SOLUTION (CURRENT DESIGN): lock item (in the external locking namespace,
                           see above) for read accesses as well, can be
                           an rw-lock.

SOLUTION: Dissolve ItemCollection layer (for ACL checking introduce an
          ACL-checking backend instead later) and make backends aware
          of the Item class. Then, an SQL backend that uses a properly
          normalised database can trivially avoid this race by having a
          table
            || ID || pagename ||
          and storing the ID in the Item object so all further accesses
          use that primary key rather than the unique key "pagename"
          which will thus not be affected by any concurrent rename, in
          effect treating the rename as though it had not happened yet.

          Even in a filesystem backend this can be implemented on actual
          operating systems by keeping a file descriptor for the item
          directory around for the lifetime of the Item object and then
          using openat(2) for accesses into the item, a rename can at
          the same time proceed as normal. For Windows (sigh) this would
          fail the rename, but the rename code could retry for a while
          before giving up with a decent error message instead of the
          current design penalising all readers.

          That way, any code that managed to get hold of an Item object
          reference need not be able to handle further problems with
          accesses to that object. Moin16 backend on windows might not
          be able to provide this guarantee but that's no worse than
          it is currently in 1.6/1.7 while still allowing improvements
          in the future which the current design completely precludes.

NOTE: If ItemCollection was being used as designed, this bug would be
      trivial to trigger due to caching (because multiple processes are
      not able to invalidate each other's caches). Luckily it is
      re-instantiated for every access so its cache is completely
      useless (see BUG 5), thereby alleviating the impact of this bug.

NOTE: The backend need not be much harder to write. Instead of all methods
      getting an 'itemname' parameter the methods would all get an 'item'
      parameter that passes the item as returned by the new get_item()
      method (that is currently done in the mid-level by ItemCollection's
      __getitem__() method) and the Item() class could still implement
      callouts to the backend methods which would not make the backend
      code much more complex but allow for better error-checking and
      lookup semantics.
